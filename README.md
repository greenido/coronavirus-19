# Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases

A starter that has a data (hopefully reliable) and news/tweets and other stuff to keep you posted.

### TODO

- Add tweets (sorted by relevancey)
- Add news (which sources?)

### Old Stuff On The Project

- This app uses sqlite but you can power your apps with [a number of other storage options](https://glitch.com/storage)
- `sqlite.db` is created and put into the `.data` folder, a hidden directory whose contents arenâ€™t copied when a project is remixed. You can see the contents of `.data` in the console under "Logs"
- To save to the database, remix this app!

On the front-end,

- Edit `views/index.html`, `public/style.css`, and `public/client.js`
- Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

- Your app starts at `server.js`
- Add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- Safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
